## Simon's Nightmare

Based on classic Simon, a great global success, this game has some features that can be a nice alternative for fans and enthusiasts of the genre. In this version I added two new buttons that can help you getting the largest number of sequences performed.
Simon is a little child that is very scared of clown, he can't sleep even when a harmless clown toy get closed to him.

Come have fun and help Simon to get distracted and fall asleep. Use the new special buttons, they will help you overcome your last Record. But beware, when Simon fail doing a sequence he can be scared! 

Note: This game was developed by me in 2013 for mobile devices, I removed this app from GooglePlay and now I'm getting available this desktop version. At this time my goal is only exhibit my first game made in Game Maker Studio.

Now, let's enjoy!
